## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This repository is a practical implementation of **Speaker Diarization**, allowing you to identify "who spoke when" in audio recordings. It focuses on:

- Segmenting audio into speaker-labeled segments.
- Calculating **Diarization Error Rate (DER)** to evaluate performance.
- Leveraging **PyAnnote** models for state-of-the-art diarization tasks.

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**

✅ **Speaker Diarization Pipeline**: Detects and labels individual speakers in an audio file.

✅ **Diarization Error Rate Calculation**: Provides detailed metrics for evaluating diarization performance (FA, MD, SC).

✅ **Flexible Usage**: Works seamlessly with custom audio datasets.

✅ **Visualization Support**: Visualize diarization segments using timeline charts.
